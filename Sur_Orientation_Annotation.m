%% Annotation of extracellular spike orientation tuning data:

%% Response of  a V1 neuron to drifting full-field gratings.


%% Dimension 1: Stimulus

%% 18 conditions:  	1-16 are stimulus direction 0-337.5 in 22.5 degree increments
%%          		17-18 are blank condition with uniform gray screen of same average luminance as grating


%% Dimension 2: Time

%% 3.5 seconds, sampled every msec (3500 time points)
%% spike = 1; no spike = 0
%% t = 0: stimulus on stationary
%% t = 500: stimulus begins drifting
%% t = 2500: stimulus off



%% Dimension 3: Trials

%% Repetitions of stimulus conditions (trials; n = 30)
